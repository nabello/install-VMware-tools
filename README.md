install-VMware-tools
====================

This is a python script that will enable you to avoid going through the various steps that are involved in installing the VMware Tools on Ubuntu.

I created it because of the large amount of times I need to go through these steps. So far it has only been tested on a vSphere infrastructure on Ubuntu 12.04 and 14.04.
